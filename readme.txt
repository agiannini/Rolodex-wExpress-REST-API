This rolodex application uses a server side API to access and modify a mongo database. It is built with Angular/Mongo/Express/Node.js.

To set up the application the user will need access to my mongo 
Database. Please email me for the login credentials. 

Another option is to create a database with an identical schema. 
The schema for my database is in a file called 'contacts' and can be 
found in the models folder within the client folder.

To set up this application:
	Clone the repository to your machine
	Use NPM to install all of the dependencies for both the 
client and the server folders
	Create a .env file with either: the username and password to my 
database, or the username and password to your database with an 
identical schema
	Load the client with the cmd 'npm run start-dev'
	Navigate to localhost:2000


This github repository includes my Angular build. As a result, if any 
changes are made to the client side, the folder will need to be 
recompiled with the Angular CLI (using ng build).


A link to a working iteration of the application can be found at my 
personal site www.alex-g-portfolio.me
